# \# Current Issues

# 

# \## Leverage branch truth-promotion status

# \- research/raw winner = phase68i\_66g\_1p50x\_static

# \- best deployment candidate = phase68i\_dynamic\_ladder\_candidate

# \- official softer fallback = phase68g\_66g\_1p25x\_candidate

# \- Phase68J simple tail-risk guardrails = rejected

# \- ordering remains unchanged

# \- leverage branch is strong enough for truth-promotion workflow

# \- leverage branch is not approved for direct auto-switch to app/live

# \- app/live toggle plumbing fields are prepared in official export contract

# \- current live truth remains 1.0x\_without\_leverage

# \- approval\_gate\_status remains pending\_or\_not\_live\_yet

# 

# \## Execution refresh branch status

# \- Hyperliquid execution branch is frozen at safe read-only + dry-run scope

# \- automation wrapper layer for execution refresh is functional

# \- canonical execution chain is:

# &#x20; 1. scripts/execution/materialize\_execution\_app\_exports.py

# &#x20; 2. scripts/execution/validate\_execution\_source\_contract.py

# &#x20; 3. scripts/execution/hyperliquid\_read\_only\_snapshot.py

# &#x20; 4. scripts/execution/render\_execution\_app\_status.py

# &#x20; 5. scripts/execution/build\_execution\_intent\_from\_strategy\_exports.py

# &#x20; 6. scripts/execution/run\_dry\_execution\_bridge.py

# \- execution outputs are decision-relevant operational artifacts, not official truth

# \- automation artifacts for execution refresh are not official truth

# \- live orders are not enabled yet

# \- source\_of\_truth writes are not part of execution refresh runtime
